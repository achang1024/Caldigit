You'll have to use an Active DP to HDMI adapter in order to facilitate this connection. Active adapters do the work of converting the digital DisplayPort signal to HDMI and are required in this case. If you aren't using the TS3 Plus' Thunderbolt port (the port next to the 'Computer' port), you could also grab a USB-C to HDMI adapter instead. I believe there's some software options to switch peripherals between computers, but I'm not very familiar with those. The alternative would be a KVM switch, but those sometimes do not play nicely with docks, so we don't officially support them. I wouldn't be able to give you any further advice there.\n"}

They're going to look into it further and see if this is something that can be potentially fixed with an update. In the meantime, I have a workaround. Instead of connecting the iPad to the 'Computer' port on the TS3 Plus, instead connect it to the other Thunderbolt port right next to the 'Computer' port. This secondary Thunderbolt port can act like the host, just like the 'Computer' port, with the only difference being that the secondary port provides up to 15W power delivery, while the 'Computer' port provides 87W. The much lower 15W should be enough for the iPad's needs, and it did not trigger this behavior when we tested it. If you use a full laptop in addition to the iPad, you may need to swap the ports back in order to retain full charging capabilities when using the laptop.\n"}
{"prompt":"caldigit ts4 - can you assign a priority monitor to have the higher refresh rate ? (dual monitor setup) Hi Community, Apologies if this is already on the forum but i could not easily find anything. I would like to handle / give priority to my main monitor using the caldigit ts4. I appreciate the bandwidth issue so not expecting dual 4k 144hz ( i think one of my monitors only supports dsc) Setup : One monitor connected via tb4 port to tb3 on primary monitor (lg 38 ultrawide) which i want to set to 4k 144hz. Second monitor (is an lg 27gp95 )is using dp 1.4 to dp 1.4 on ts4. I can get to work by manually putting in the ports in sequence main monitor then secondary after, painful and not workable. This achieves desired setup of 1st monitor 4k 144hz, 2nd Monitor 4k (95hz or 60). However on switching computer on with everything connected to caldigit ts4 , it goes to 1st monitor 4k 75hz and 2nd monitor 4k 144. Any help would be greatly appreciated- btw on ts3+ this worked fine as display port was only 1.2 so 2nd monitor could only reach 60hz, which meant 1st monitor got the 144hz. I tried to simulate this by setting the lg 27 to display port 1.2 mode which kind of works, but not for macbook m1 pro , or my other mini pc (usb4)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I believe monitor priority is assigned based on which is detected by the OS first during initialization. Technically, there is a sequence for which monitor ports on the dock are powered and activate first, which could be a contributing factor here. I can't say for certain, but if you could swap how the monitors are plugged in, so the higher refresh target monitor is connected over the USB-C/ Thunderbolt connection, that could do the trick. Looks like the 27GP95 does not have USB-C, so you would need to get a USB-C adapter (either to DP 1.4 or HDMI 2.1) in order to facilitate this change. You could also possibly hardware limit the connection with a USB-C to DP 1.2 adapter. If one of the monitors initializes considerably faster than the other, this may not fix the behavior, however. The first workaround I can think of then would be to delay powering up of the lower-refresh targeted monitor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Did I get a dud cable? Or the wrong cable? Hi, I have a Dell XPS-13 7390 2-in-1 laptop with core-i7 1065G7, a CalDigit Ts3+ dock and two Asus 4k monitors. By using the displayport for one monitor and a usb-c to DP cable for the other, I am able to have both monitors AND my laptop running in full 4k. Have had it runnig for about 4 years and it's great - in fact I love it so much I have duplicated the setup at home (except with Samsung monitors) so I can just take my laptop between home and office and with one cable plugged in I can have identical working environment. As a result of redecorating the home office, I need to be able to place my laptop further from the TS3+ dock. I have got myself in a real mess understanding the differences (or lack thereof) between 'proper' thunderbolt and USB-C but thought I'd figured out that a cable which can carry 20Gbps would suffice - so I purchased this cable from Amazon - https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B0CCF99VZ9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details which claims to be Thundebolt 4\/3 compatible and capable of 8k resolution.

My immediate assumption is that I've screwed up and come to the wrong conclusion in my research - however I have noticed that the monitor that DOES show picture (the one connected to the DP port) looks terrible - the resolution is correct but it's somewhat 'blurry' and has a greenish hue across the whole screen., Before I go and shell out a load more cash for a 'certified' thunderbolt cable - can anyone double check and confirm that I am indeed an idiot and that this cable was never going to be able to output signal to two monitors? If I connect the second monitor to the other thunderbolt port on my laptop I get the second monitor (and anyway it's been working fine for years) so clearly dock anbd laptop are up to the job - the cable is the only thing that's changed.

The secondary monitor is a rather old Eizo CG222W that only has two DVI-I and one VGA output, and was previously connected via a USB-C to DVI-D cable, which worked fine. However, I wanted to connect the Eizo to the TS4 using a DisplayPort - DVI-D cable to free up a USB-C port on the back. Unfortunately, the monitor connected in this way does not receive a signal. I tried both DVI-I ports on the monitor. The DisplayPort on the dock itself works, as I connected the primary monitor (Dell) to the TS4 with a DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable and the image appeared on the monitor. I also bought a special DisplayPort to DVI-D ACTIVE cable (pictured below), but when connected to the TS4 it has no effect (no signal). The cable itself works as I have connected the Eizo monitor to the PC with it and it was working just fine. Any suggestions?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I'm pretty sure the cable is at fault here. When we suggest using an Active DisplayPort adapter, 'Active' in this context refers to a technology that changes the digital signal from DisplayPort to the destination type, DVI-D in this case. However, when it comes to cables, 'Active' can mean this, but it can also refer to a different technology that amplifies the signal which allows the cable to be longer than conventionally possible. Reading the marketing materials for this cable (from this website), they pretty specifically reference that this cable is 'active' in the latter sense, meaning it is not compatible with our docks in this way. If possible, I recommend you return this cable, and instead get an Active DisplayPort to DVI-D adapter. We don't sell those anymore, but there are options out there. The marketing materials for this adapter suggests it should work, though we haven't tested it ourselves, so I can't say for certain.\n"}
{"prompt":"TS4 dock with 3 monitors? Hi, I'm currently looking for a dock that supports the use case I have, but I'm not sure if this is possible with the TS4 dock. I basically want to move my PC in another room while having my monitors, mouse, keyboard etc in the current room. I plan to do this with the 'Optical Thunderbolt 3 cable' from Corning (Link). My current monitor setup consists of: 1x 4K HDR @ 144Hz (DisplayPort) 2x 1080p @ 60Hz (HDMI) Peripherals (all connected with USB): Mouse Keyboard Wireless Headset (Astro A50) Will my current setup work with the TS4 dock? Is there anything I have to keep in mind? If this doesn't work, can anyone recommend a dock that would work for my use case? Thanks in advance🤗\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is no good native way to do this with hardware. Thunderbolt 4 is capable of driving up to two monitors over a single connection. There's two possible options here: One is to leverage MST in some way to connect the 1080p monitors. MST essentially splits the video signal so that two monitors can operate over a single signal. If you are on Windows or Linux this could be possible. You may be able to find a Thunderbolt 4 dock with an MST hub built in, but we don't sell one of those and I haven't heard of any. MST hubs also exist as standalone devices, so you could get an MST hub and plug both the monitors and the TS4 into that. Finally, some monitors have MST hubs built-in. If your monitors support this, they will likely have a DisplayPort output port that you would use for this. The other option is to use DisplayLink for the third monitor. DisplayLink uses software to drive additional monitors, requiring the use of drivers and a physical DisplayLink adapter to facilitate this connection. DisplayLink also takes up more compute power than a normal hardware connection would, so it's not ideal. If you want to go this route, some docks include a built-in DisplayLink powered port (none of ours do, we prefer hardware connections generally), or you can add DisplayLink to any dock with a USB DisplayLink adapter. I should also mention that the cable you're planning on getting can be hit or miss with Thunderbolt 4 docks. We see more support cases related to this cable than we would expect for such a niche product, and the behavior is often resolved by removing the cable from the setup. So, if you do try this, I recommend that you get the cable from a place that you can return and replace it easily should you need to, and that you test everything before you move the computer to the other room, just in case it doesn't work.\n"}

{"prompt":"CalDigit 'Active DP to HDMI Adapter'... doesn't like HDR? I have a Corsair TBT100 (TB3 dock) connected to my M1 Mac. My monitor (AOC Q27G3XMN) is connecting HDMI -> CalDigit Adapter -> DP on the Dock. While it is able to support 1440p @ 144Hz, it is not able to negotiate HDR... it's not in the Display menu in MacOS as an option, and the monitor's OSD shows it is using SDR. I thought maybe the refresh was too high and the bandwidth couldn't support it, but lowering it to 60Hz doesn't allow HDR either. I decided to try my monitor's DP input directly to the TB3 dock, and that works brilliantly. Not only does HDR work, but it can also go up to my monitor's max rate of 180Hz. Unfortunately, my monitor only has 1x DP, and it's going to my gaming rig... hence the use of the HDMI input for the dock.

The M1 Pro MacBook should be able to support this, but you might get refresh rate capped by the operating system at 120hz.\n\nThe gaming PC might be a little more complex. If you have Thunderbolt on the motherboard, the motherboard also has to support graphics input from the graphics card.

I am specifically talking about getting a video connection between the motherboard and the graphics card. If there is no connection, the motherboard will use the CPU's integrated GPU (if it has one), and will not use the graphics card at all. This will yield poor performance in any application that would want the graphics card if it works at all.\nSo what you are looking for is most likely a DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort input port near the TB port on the motherboard - this is the most common way to connect a motherboard's Thunderbolt port to a graphics card. If you have one or two of these ports, connect them to your graphics card for the Thunderbolt port to use the graphics card video signal. If your motherboard only has one of these ports, you'll only be able to get a single monitor working out of the Thunderbolt connection and through the dock.\nMany motherboards with Thunderbolt do not have these ports, so if you can't find it, it's not exactly uncommon. In this case, your motherboard may be able to pull video internally over the Graphics card PCIe signal (at least, that's how I understand it), or the Thunderbolt port does not support video from the graphics card, in which case you probably should not connect the monitors to this Thunderbolt port, as you'll get much better performance plugging them directly into the graphics card.\nIf your computer does not have video input for the Thunderbolt ports, you may be able to get a Thunderbolt add-in card, which almost always has input ports for video. These are manufacturer specific, so you can check if your motherboard's manufacturer carries one for your specific motherboard."}

Can I purchase 2 of these docks and run 4 monitors total?", "completion": "Maybe.\nYour basis is right - this computer supports dual monitors and up to 2 monitors can be supported per Thunderbolt chain.\nApple's tech specs for the Apple Silicon Max Lineup says that one monitor has to be connected over the computer's HDMI port. However, we found on the M1 Max that we were able to get quad monitors over two docks, as you are suggesting. Unless something has changed between then and now, this should work! Hence, the maybe."}
{"prompt": "Does TS3 plus support 6k 60hz Prodisplay XDR?\nLooking to buy a dock for my mbp14 with m1max and prodisplay XDR. TS4 can support dual 6k 60hz, but it seems like an overkill for me, plus there is no silver finish option. TS3 plus spec sheet says that it supports single 5K 60hz, but did not mention anything about 6k. Will ts3 plus work with a single prodisplay XDR?", "completion": "No, the TS3 Plus does not support 6k 60hz resolution. Thunderbolt 3 tech (including the TS3 Plus) utilizes DisplayPort 1.2, which is not capable of reaching 6k60hz. For this resolution, you'll need a Thunderbolt 4 dock, like the TS4, which utilizes DisplayPort 1.4."}
{"prompt": "Using element and TS4 at same time\nMy job is switching over from elite books to surface laptops. This means I’m probably losing one direct USBA (have 2 USBA, 2 thunderbolts and HDMI 2.0 on elitebook- moving to 2 TB4 and 1 USBA)\nIn short, I’m using a TS3Plus at work- I have a 3840 x 1600 ultrawide plus 3 other screens- 4k, 2k, and HD display. I currently have a powered Saberrent USBA hub that hosts 2 plugable external video adapters to make the displays work. The powered USBA ADAPTER connects to a Caldigit TS3 PLUS. And the two higher resolution monitors connect directly to Caldigit TS3 Dock.\nI use a 2.4 ghz mouse and 2.4hgz wireless keyboard, both connected directly to laptop. Have a second keyboard connected to 2.4ghz on the TS3pkus directly but it lags a little with all the throughput already connected. (It all makes sense if you saw my office setup- surprisingly less overkill than you’d think)\nI have a TS4 at my home office that I probably don’t need to use there anymore and an element hub I carry in my backpack because honestly, I’m just a little obsessive....and Bc I have several multi monitor setups.\nI know I can replace the 3Plus with my TS4, but can I replace the USBA Hub with the element hub for the 2 video card adapters and 2 (or even 3) of the 2.4ghz adapters? (I can’t download any firmware onto my laptop so I have to use the docks as is, and I’m worried about the connections getting confused)", "completion": "So the intent is to use the TS4 and and the Element Hub at the same time, with separate Thunderbolt ports on the computer, and 2-3 monitors between the two docks?\nThis should be possible with some caveats. Thunderbolt implementation from computer manufacturers is often opaque and asymmetrically implemented. The big problem that could happen here is if the computer has a single Thunderbolt BUS that both Thunderbolt ports share. In that case, you can get the full 40Gbps bandwidth and 2 video streams across both Thunderbolt ports, as opposed to getting 40Gbps and 2 video streams on each.\nDepending on this, you may be hard limited to 2 native external displays (more can be added with DisplayLink, but that's a separate conversation).\nOther than that, it sounds like the bandwidth needed for the rest of your peripherals is mostly negligible. Keyboards, mice, and other peripherals like that use very little bandwidth, so you could likely easily fit all of this on one dock or the other (other than extra monitors).\nRegardless, it's fine to plug in both the Element Hub and the TS4 at the same time, both will work independently. In fact, you could plug the Element Hub into the TS4 if you wanted to and that would work fine as well. (not that it sounds appropriate for this setup, but just as an example).\nAs an aside, that wireless keyboard lag is probably caused by wireless interference introduced by the USB ports on the TS3 Plus. This is a documented part of USB 3 specification and can be overcome by using a USB extension cable to physically move your USB wireless receiver away from the dock."}

That didn’t register at all.\nI pulled the dp to usbc out of the TS3 plus and placed directly into the second USBC port. 4k monitor still didn’t register.\nI then pulled SABERRENT hub out the TS 3 and put directly into USBA on laptop. Kept TS3 plus connected and left DP 1.2 to usbc (DP 1.4 cable) ON LAPTOP. HD QHD, and 3840x 1600 all registered, 4k screen still not recognized.\nMoved the dp to usbc wire on 4k back to TS3plus, kept SABERRENT hub connected.

Typed in Thunderbolt 4 and saw this Port 1 USB 4 2tunnels 20 gbs Port 2 USB 4 1 tunnel 20 gbs\nIt’s an intel certified elite book with i5 (different laptop) - this confuses me. After done digging, I suppose this new laptop is using lower bandwidth USB4 ports? Which would make some sense. I’m perplexed though as I’m not in tech- just a crazy school counselor who found a solid system during covid that makes me far more efficient. So I’m perplexed- is it possible to have an intel laptop using using same i5 chip as my laptop from 2020 that uses a usb 4 (with only 20gbs per port?)\nAt end of day, I noticed my laptop had a charging icon but was actually losing power. Never had that happen on the laptop I returned today with 2 TB4 ports, nor was that an issue on my previous laptop that only had one TB3 port.\nI know this is a long explanation - but should I effectively treat this like it’s my old one port TB3 laptop?\nBack then, I ran this exact same screen setup but I had inputs configured different: the SABERRENT hub directly went directly into USBA ports, the 4k screen connected via the HDMI, and then ultrawide 3840x1600 connected via DP TO DP ON TS3...or usbc to Thunderbolt visvia dp alt mode.\nI have a UGreen certified 8k @ 120hz hdmi 2.1 cable I’m gonna connect from 4k to hdmi tomorrow to see if that fixes things.\nAlso taking my Caldigit TS4 to work to see if that fixes it somehow, but Im thinking it won’t make a difference.\nIs it possible an elite book i5 laptop would offer an option of USB 4 rather than just go TB4?\nIf these ARE usb4 with 20gbs- one with 2 tunnels and the other with 1, than the TS4 will do nothing bc usb4 20gbs is causing bottlenecking?\nMy DP TO USBC cord from 4k RECOGNIZING 4k monitor via ts3 plus bc usb4 20gbs lacks enough bandwidth to Run dual 4k through 2 tunnel usbc 4 input?\nOr is it simply bc usb4 may not have have dp alt mode configured at all?\nIs it possible there’s an error and display link isn’t downloading via updates as it should?\nAnd can usb4 1 tunnel 20gbs port not connect with my 4k monitor when connected directly DP 1.2 to usbc bc it lacks either bandwidth or simply can’t do so alt mode?\nLike I said, this is just shit I figured out bc multi screens were a necessity during covid and I went slightly overboard- but now my workflow and office config depends on this setup.\nAnd does the lack of charging have to do with 2 tunnels/tunnel?m bottleneck? I know, lots of questions-\n(As an fyi I’m granted a special permission to use all this shit I bc purchased myself during covid when the former head of tech wouldn’t help me with so much as a second screen...so there’s really no asking for tech help directly)\nGonna try connecting via hdmi direct to laptop to get the 4k monitor running first, than try swapping to ts4 and playing with configs. I’m pretty sure head of tech isn’t protesting, but is of the mind that if I can figure this out on my own he’s gonna be fine with it, but that’s the extent of support I’ll get- aside from asking these same questions.\nThanks to those who read through this- since I’m doing this all via diy and trial by fire, I could use any insight/help I can get", "completion": "I'm not overly familiar with USB4, but it sounds like possibly both of the USB ports share a single USB4 BUS, meaning they both collectively can support up to 40Gbps. By plugging into both, it's possible that the connection is splitting itself into two 20Gbps connections. This would cause bottlenecking. Sounds probably then that there could be a hardware limitation on the Thunderbolt 3 connection limiting monitor support down to a single monitor.\nI am curious to see if the TS4 makes a difference or not. Since it's a USB4 connection, only one monitor may work on that as well - not quite sure if the TS4 will fall back to Thunderbolt 3 or USB mod. Even if it falls back to Thunderbolt 3, which would be optimal here, I suspect that theoretical hardware limitation will still limit monitor support to a single monitor.\nThis isn't a DP alt. mode issue, nor an issue with DisplayLink (which isn't a factor with the TS3 Plus). Thunderbolt 3 uses a native video specification, which does seem to be working (otherwise the TS3 Plus wouldn't work at all).\nPower issue is tough to say. Are you plugging the computer into the \"Computer\" port on the TS3 Plus? Technically, either Thunderbolt dock on the TS3 Plus can work as a host to the computer, but the secondary Thunderbolt port provides up to 15W, while the \"Computer\" port provides up to the full 87W.\nIf that's not the issue, historically, some HP laptops have rejected power from third party products, including our docks. This used to show up as the dock constantly power cycling and not working, but it may have changed shape."}
{"prompt": "Hi! So TS4 didn’t make a difference. I ended up connecting an overly powerful 8k60hz hdmi 2.1 cable from the 4k monitor to the hdmi port.\nPretty sure I can pull the hd webcam off the saberrant powered USBA hub now too.\nNow that I’ve pretty much accepted that I may need the hdmi port on laptop, I figured I should probably optimize all the wonderful features of the TS4 for more than just monitor expansion. The rest of the monitors are now hooked into the TS4 directly. So a 3840 x 1600 via DisplayPort, a QHD via plug able 4k (60hz?) DP to usb A adapter (has external video card) hd w plugable 2k 60hz do to usb A adapter (has external video card).\nInitially, I kept the two plugable dP to usba adapter monitors on the saberrant hub. Plugged that into the USBA on laptop (tried same side as USBC ports and on opposite side) and then tried plugging into Caldigit TA 4 (just as I had on TS3). None worked.\nMy wireless 75% keyboard and wireless numpad are connected hardwire- 1 to the rear USBc w/ undocked charging & the other to rear w/ undocked charging.\nIm out of my depth at this point, as I’m sure you can tell based on your (much appreciated) clarification. The 40gbps across both ports makes a lot of sense based off what I’m seeing in real time. I’m just perplexed that I’m looking at a Thunderbolt 4 logo in between the 2 usbc ports just as I did on my previous laptop and I’m only seeing USB4 v1 pop up in “Bluetooth and Devices” on windows setting.\nCaldigit TS4 is clearly recognized, but second display did not show up from tb4-DP1.4 wire as it did on previous laptop.\nRealistically, harnessing the TS4 the way I’m using it now is probably a net gain bc I can it seems I can ditch the additional USBA powered hub from my setup, but I’m irrationally salty that my new laptop isn’t supporting everything through the TS 3 plus or TS4. Mostly bc the HDMI cable I’m using is way overkill and too thick to rest on my Anker desktop cable management pad while not in use. That 2.1 cable was originally going to be used to connect a Lenovo mini pc to my lg c1 OLED while I used its tb3 capabilities and other inputs to hook into other monitors and peripherals. It’s just kind of annoying I have these higher end DP cables I’m not using now. The only silver lining is they’re brand new, so I’ll be futureproofed whenever the time comes.\nIt’s probably a futile/poorly thought attempt at a fix, but Im going to try connecting the Caldigit usbc to hdmi 2.2 8k 60hz adapter to a Thunderbolt port on the ts4 and then connect my hdmi cable to the adapter. It sounds like this won’t matter but if it doesn’t work I can return to Amazon or find another use case.\nIf what you’re suggesting about the two usbc ports is correct, does this mean there’s no workaround to getting this last 4k display to run through the TS4?\nI was thinking of trying a usbc to hdmi or dp adapter with MST . But again, I’m guessing I’m out of my depth and throwing blind darts at a bullseye- but I’m too curious to not try at this point","completion": "What cable are you using to connect the dock and your computer? If you haven't already, try swapping that out, preferably with another CalDigit Thunderbolt cable if you have the cable from the other dock around. It could also be possible that the cable is limiting the connection down for some reason. Make sure you're using a Thunderbolt cable no matter what.\nMy theory about the port splitting the connection would theoretically be fixed by removing the Sabrent hub entirely and then not using that port anymore. Since you're considering removing it, this could be easy to test and see.\nIt is definitely odd that the Thunderbolt logo is present and yet the computer is throttling the connection this badly. Thunderbolt 4 is supposed to mandate that all computers do in fact support dual monitors over the connection (but some manufacturers have slipped around this requirement - base level Apple Silicon computers for example). Thunderbolt 3, however, does not have this requirement, and only needs at least one monitor support for certification.\nAn MST hub could help, but I believe if you're plugging in the two 4k monitors you are only going to get 30hz, which would not be ideal. If that's acceptable to you, let's keep that in the back pocket in case nothing else works.\nIf the above doesn't do the trick, let's take a few steps back on troubleshooting and see if we can find another possible culprit that could be causing this behavior. I kind of skipped over this since we knew everything was previously working, but something might not be playing nice with the new computer specifically.\nWith the dock and computer connected and turned, start by plugging in both of the 4k monitors (and none of the other monitors connected in any way) in the simplest way possible - one connected directly via DisplayPort if possible (if you are converting to HDMI, make sure you are using an Active DisplayPort to HDMI adapter or the connection may not work), and the other plugged into one of the dock's Thunderbolt ports, either directly or with an adapter. Note down how these are connected and which one works. Let's call the working monitor \"Monitor 1\", and the non-working monitor \"Monitor 2\".\nNow, unplug Monitor 1 and note what happens. Does Monitor 2 now turn on?\nIf it works, skip ahead past this paragraph. If it doesn't work still, this suggests a problem in Monitor 2's cabling or the monitor itself. To determine this more granularly, try plugging Monitor 1's cabling into Monitor 2 if possible and see if it works. If it does work, that suggests the cabling that is currently not connected is the culprit. Otherwise, the problem may be something with Monitor 2 itself (sometimes this can be a DisplayPort version issue if connected over DP - changing the DisplayPort version on the problem monitor's settings can resolve this in that case).\nIf any given monitor connection works as long as there is only one connected, we're back to a bandwidth issue. This is could be a Thunderbolt cable issue - if you still haven't tried swapping out the cables, definitely do so now. Otherwise, it's an issue with the computer itself.\nHopefully something here can shed some further light on this setup and perhaps point us in a direction to help resolve this."}

If you can, try connecting the charger that came with the MacBook, and leave both that and the Element Hub plugged in for a day and see if the behavior goes away. With both of these plugged in, the MacBook should instead charge from the computer charger instead of the Element Hub (this is totally safe for the computer if you are concerned). This is just for the sake of testing, and can inform ways we can possibly resolve this more permanently.\n\nIt could also be something connected to the Element Hub, though nothing really stands out to me. The lamp could be a little suspect, but I also kind of doubt that would cause it. You could try disconnecting that and anything else that isn't immediately necessary and see if that helps improve. Knowing that there is a problematic device causing this could also help.\nThe monitors are also separately powered, so they should not be actually pulling power from the Element Hub. They could be introducing misbehavior here, but if they are, it's not related to power draw."}

Am I right ?", "completion": "Am I reading this correct that you want to connect the TS4 to both your PC and the MacBook? Just so you know, you can only connect the dock to one 'host' computer at a time, so you can't connect both computers to the dock and have the monitor work for both computers, or anything like that.\nYou can connect the monitor and TS4 together over DisplayPort, and then The MacBook to that and it should just work. As for the PC, it's a little complicated because there's a lot of possible variables.\nWhat kind of computer do you have? If the PC has a USB-C port that supports video (this is sometimes called DisplayPort Alt. mode), you can connect the TS4 to that port, and with that you can get one monitor on the TS4, and everything else will work other than Ethernet. If the PC has a Thunderbolt port, it may also support video, up to two monitors, and everything, including Ethernet, will work.\nIf you have a desktop PC, it may not support video over any USB-C port, in which case you will want to connect the monitor directly to the PC with an HDMI cable most likely.\nHope this helps clear things up.

I have sorted that I can use an HDmi to USBC adapter so that the second computer (the pc) can get plugged in. Is it reasonable to expect that if I turn off one and turn on the other it takes over ? I basically needed this to minimize cables etc (all the other devices are either BT or linked to the caldigit). Thanks", "completion": "Sorry, gotta cover my bases! Sometimes people do expect to somehow use both computers at the same time with our products.\nThe TS4 can only connect to hosts over the host 'Computer' port. Both the other Thunderbolt ports can only act as downstream ports. So you will have to physically unplug one computer and plug in the other in some way."}
{"prompt": "OR switch to a KVM solution ... right ?", "completion": "A KVM could work with the TS4, but it depends on how you intend to use it. Virtually all KVMs on the market are USB-based, so in order to preserve the Thunderbolt functionality of the TS4, you would want to plug the KVM downstream of the dock. Technically you can use the KVM upstream of the dock, but this will force the dock into USB-C mode, where the Ethernet will no longer work and only one monitor will be supported at a time."}

I also need to connect the capture card and the SSD enclosure each time I switch between my business (Dell Latitude) and personal (MBP) computers. I'm currently utilizing all 3 Thunderbolt 4 ports on my Mac. Zero issues I have two questions: 1- I plan to connect TS4 with the Dell monitor via DisplayPort cable, can this free (to some extent) the rest of TS4 bandwidth to accommodate the rest of the devices with a single Thunderbolt 4? Most important, will the SSD enclosure speed be affected with these loads? 2- What issues/glitches can I expect with this setup? (if any) and any workaround it? I have seen some issues with this dock, even with MBP M1 Pro, but also seen some great reviews. I can't go for ivanky docking station as I'm using both PC and Mac. Any suggestions?", "completion": "First, a big word of warning! We have seen major connectivity issues with video capture devices like the 4k X, particularly from ElGato, when connected through Thunderbolt 4 docks like the TS4, and into Apple Silicon devices, like your M1 Pro MacBook. We think this behavior has something to do with how Apple Silicon handles Thunderbolt 4 connections. It is specifically these three things: Video capture device - Thunderbolt 4 dock - Apple Silicon computer. I would warn you to probably steer clear entirely of a Thunderbolt 4 dock if you intend to use the 4k X with your MacBook. We have found that some video capture devices work okay; AVerMedia's seems to work more reliably than ElGato devices, but the only real solution is to either use a different computer or use a different kind of dock. We have found that Thunderbolt 3 docks, like our TS3 Plus, work totally fine. It is specifically Thunderbolt 4 docks that show issue. In fact, we've found that connecting an Apple Silicon computer into our TS4, then a TS3 Plus into that, and then connecting problematic video capture devices into the TS3 Plus will work totally fine. It's a very weird behavior with these computers. As for the actual bandwidth constraints here: I believe there is technically enough Thunderbolt bandwidth to connect all these devices at once, but Thunderbolt 4 actually mandates that every USB connection sits behind a single 10Gbps BUS, so I don't think you would practically be able to use all of this at once. Thunderbolt 3 does not have this mandate, so you could technically get more overall USB bandwidth. So again our TS3 Plus may be an option here. Here's the BUS breakdown to see how you could allocate the ports and make this setup possibly fit. There is one 10Gbps BUS on the TS3 Plus that has 2 ports, so between the 4k X and the Cam Pro, you might not have enough bandwidth. But as long as you are recording 1080p60hz through the 4k X, it would probably work on a 5Gbps port. It could probably not handle 4k60hz recording, though. Your needs are really close to the edge of what is possible with current Thunderbolt technology. I think you will probably have better luck overall with a Thunderbolt 3 solution, like our TS3 Plus just for your USB bandwidth needs. However, no matter what, I think you're going to run into some bandwidth constraints, and you might have to unload the 4k X and/or Cam Pro."}
{"prompt": "CalDigit TS3 acting funny with Dell USB-C screen. I have a Dell USB-C screen connected via USB-C cable to my CalDigit TS3 hub.

Switching to the desktop works fine when the laptop is plugged into the TS3, but when my laptop is not plugged in, the USB-C screen refuses to switch to the desktop, and I need to unplug the TS3 from the screen. So it's almost like the CalDigit hub does something strange upstream when it doesn't see a downstream connection.", "completion": "Thunderbolt docks and KVMs tend to have weird behaviors with each other that introduce unique quirks like this. Even with the laptop disconnected, the dock is still 'On' to some degree, even though it doesn't have a host. The Dell KVM monitor is likely picking this up but can't properly initialize into the KVM connection and is getting stuck in a state where it thinks it's connecting to the non-existent laptop connected to the dock. This is probably compounded by the KVM not being able to switch connections in this state, which would normally help give time to the computer to initialize properly and prevent rapid switching between the KVM sources before they can properly connect. The KVM expects a very consistent environment to operate in, and without a laptop connected, connecting to the dock puts it in an unexpected and unplanned state that there's no fallback for without physical disconnection."}
{"prompt": "All makes sense. The tl;dr here is probably then there's no elegant solution here, right?", "completion": "Not as far as I can tell. Like I said, KVMs and Thunderbolt docks tend to have weird behaviors. There's not really a be-all-end-all fix when that happens. The only real workaround I can think of is to always swap the connection when you intend to unplug the laptop. The only actual permanent fixes I can think of are either Dell or us issuing a firmware update, but at least on our end, that's not very likely. The part of the TS3 Plus that I think would be contributing to this behavior is what we call Offline Charging, where ports remain active when the computer is disconnected so that connected devices can continue to charge.

I have also tried another Element Hub and see the same behavior. I have a third hub I could try, but I figured it would be the same result.

I also recommend you try plugging into one of the USB-C ports on the Element Hub if you are able.

This sounds like a possible HBR lane conflict. This would possibly work fine if the monitors were 1440p144hz native, but since they are 4k native, they each want to use an extra HBR lane that they don't need, so there's only bandwidth for one to reach your target refresh rate. I'm not sure if this is actually correctable or not with this setup, but it's worth reaching out to our support team and checking all the same. I'm also a little stumped on the mouse, as you've already tried what I would expect to correct things, but our support team can help further with that.

{"prompt": "Macbook Pro M3 Pro and TS3+ Dock - 4k HDR Support? I spent a few hours looking for this information yesterday, and could not get a reliable answer. I recently received a Macbook Pro M3 Pro + TS3+ dock to work from home. Since the 16\" screen is a bit too small for my needs, I'm looking at getting either two 27\" 4k HDR monitors (Dell S2722QC) or a 43-48\" monitor that also supports 4K HDR. I have not seen any place that mentions whether this dock supports 4k HDR, or HDR in general. Does either the Thunderbolt port or Displayport on the TS3+ dock support HDR? What happens if I plug in the Dell S2722QC, which does have HDR? I can connect via USB C cable or Displayport to HDMI on this monitor Is there any workaround to getting HDR to work without having to plug directly into one of the other Thunderbolt ports on my Mac (kind of defeats the purpose)? Any help would be greatly appreciated.", "completion": "Unfortunately, the TS3 Plus does not support HDR. This is because the TS3 Plus uses Thunderbolt 3's DisplayPort 1.2 specification, which does not have HDR support. DisplayPort 1.4 is the first DP revision with HDR support, so you would need a Thunderbolt 4 dock, which uses DP 1.4 protocol, in order to get HDR out of these monitors from a one cable solution to your computer."}
{"prompt": "If I were to get a 42in LG oled TV as my monitor, and plug it in directly to my Mac, could I still use the TS3+ for everything else except the monitor? Does it work as basically a USB C Hub when not using it to drive the monitors?", "completion": "Yeah, the TS3 Plus works with or without monitors!"}
{"prompt": "You've been so helpful, so thank you for your responses. I'm also set on going with the LG Oled TV as my main monitor, but I do run two Macs (Studio M2 Max and MBP M3 Pro) and have one more question. Is there a USB C switcher that works with the TS3+ so that I don't have to connect/disconnect all of the peripherals on the TS3+ when I switch? The TV I can just switch from Input 1 to Input 2 to switch, but with the TS3+, I'd currently need to disconnect the USB C from one computer to the other.", "completion": "Which LG are you going for and are you aiming for higher than 60hz? Currently, macOS does not support HDMI 2.1 over Thunderbolt, which is what would be required to use the monitor at higher than 4k60hz. In this case, you'd only be able to get above 4k60hz when plugged into the computer's HDMI port. Are you planning on swapping the entire TS3 Plus between both computers? If so, it's technically possible, but it's not cheap and there's limited options. The TS3 Plus is Thunderbolt only, so it has to connect to a Thunderbolt host. If you plug the TS3 Plus into a switch/ KVM, that switch would have to support Thunderbolt - no USB only switch would work. I know of one Thunderbolt 4 KVM available to consumers, the Sabrent Thunderbolt 4 KVM. We haven't tested with it extensively, but it should work in this case. The other option is to connect the KVM to a USB port on the switch. Only USB devices would work this way, but it's something, and you could use any switch theoretically. We don't technically support this, so I couldn't really offer specifics, but it could work. We've seen mixed results from users, possibly related to the quality of KVM they use, but as we don't support it, we don't have any documentation logged on what works and doesn't. In this scenario the TS3 Plus would be dedicated to one of your devices, probably the MacBook Pro, and the KVM would hold the peripherals you want to jump between both devices. In this way, the KVM would act as a kind of USB hub for those devices."}

{"prompt": "Digital noise (crackling) when using USB audio interface through TS4 Hi! So I just picked up a TS4 and I'm having trouble with my audio interface. I'm using the 1010 bluebox mixer/interface and it works fine when directly connected to my Macbook (2021, M1 Max running Sonoma 14.4). However, when I run the interface through the TS4, I get a digital \"crackling\" noise about every 40-60 seconds and it lasts for about 10 seconds each time. My normal setup is: LG monitor connected via thunderbolt 4 in back Focusrite Scarlet 4i4 connected to USB-A on the back Razer Kiyo webcam connected to USB-A on the back I removed all other connections to isolate the issue and it still happens with nothing else (but the bluebox) plugged into the TS4. The bluebox is just regular class-compliant USB audio so no drivers. I've tried connecting it through my current USB-B to USB-A cable as well as USB-B to USB-C cable. I've tried connecting it via one of these cables to literally every port on the dock with no change in behavior (including connecting to one of the thunderbolt 4 connections on the back, as I read these have the highest data priority). I've also tried every USB-C port on the Macbook just for the hell of it, with no change there either. So I'm kind of at a loss. I'm using the included thunderbolt 4 cable that came with the TS4 and I've also tried swapping that one for a different thunderbolt4 cable just to be sure. Still no difference. The audio crackling happens regardless of the source -- spotify app, youtube in Chrome, or audio in a Zoom meeting. It also happens when my output from the mixer is a different set of speakers (just to be sure). The thing that's most interesting here is that I have literally no problems at all when using my HP Victus 16 PC laptop running Windows 11. So there's some incompatibility with how the Macbook is using the audio interface through the doc vs when it's directly connected. I'm following up w/ 1010 as well but no response so far -- from what I see in the forums their reponse is always \"the hub is the problem, remove it or get a better one\" which is why I got the TS4 despite it's high price. Anyone else running a Macbook with a USB audio device through the TS4 with success? I've messed with what I can in the \"Audio MIDI Setup\" with no luck there 😅 either. I haven't been able to find any info on other settings I could try to tweak via terminal commands...

Is the TS4 broken?", "completion": "It doesn't sound like the TS4 is broken if it's otherwise working fine. It's more likely that the TS4 is picking up some signal from the computer when they both turn on at the same time. What happens if you unplug the TS4 from the computer, then do this power cycle, then plug the TS4 back in? I suspect it will clear out this issue. Granted, that's marginally less work than you are doing right now.

I have tried all possible cables I have and no dice. I really don't want to return this, so hoping there's a fix. Appreciate the help!", "completion": "I believe the resolution of 5k2k is less than 4k60hz, so both should be supported as long as the computer does, and the M2 Pro chip is capable of dual monitors. Is there any rhyme or reason for the monitor that does not work? Like, it's always over DisplayPort or something like that? If you only plug in one monitor at a time, do both of them work independently of the other? Here's some of our standard troubleshooting tests that could clear out this behavior: First, we recommend you power cycle your dock. You can do this by disconnecting it from wall power for 30-45 seconds before plugging it back in. This will allow the dock to fully discharge, which can help clear out unexpected behaviors. Next, let’s turn our attention to the data connection. We always recommend using the included CalDigit Thunderbolt cable to ensure compatibility, but if you are currently using it, it’s possible this is a contributor to this situation. If you have access to another Thunderbolt cable, we recommend trying this and seeing if the behavior improves. In this same vein, if your computer has multiple Thunderbolt ports, we recommend trying an alternative port. In some rare cases, we have seen individual ports may cause erratic behavior, and testing with another port helps eliminate variables. Beyond that, I recommend that you get in touch with our support team for further diagnosis and troubleshooting. When you reach out, link them back to this thread for reference.

The 1440 tall would be low enough bandwidth that it works (which is what I may have erroneously assumed - I previously used an LG monitor of this resolution that was advertised 5k2k and it worked with dual monitors fine). 5120x2160 would be higher than 4k resolution bandwidth. 4k60hz is about the limit that a Thunderbolt connection can handle without Display Stream Compression (DSC for short), which could push the limit up to dual 6k60hz. There's an unfortunate sweet-spot of monitors right about 4k but below 6k that could leverage DSC, but do not. It sounds like depending on your monitor, this could be what's happening here. In this case, there would not be a way on current Thunderbolt tech for you to get both of these monitors working through a dock over hardware."}

I however recently bought a gaming desktop (Windows machine) and I don't feel like changing my setup. What I am essentially looking for is switching between my MBP and Windows Desktop just by switching the same thunderbolt cable between them. Alternatively, if there is a hub switch of some sorts which can help me with this. I know that my PC does not have a TB port, but it does have a USB-C connector running USB3.2 - while good enough for most applications, running 2 displays + other things might not be the best idea. Are there any solutions that you recommend or others in the community have tried? I saw a couple of USB 3.0 switches from Plugable but it is no better than moving the TB cable manually. Do you recommend a PCIe Thunderbolt card?", "completion": "Your monitors are going to have a bad time here if you don't have Thunderbolt support. Over USB-C, up to one monitor could work, but in desktop environments, the USB-C port doesn't always have video support. If that monitors works, it will most likely be pulling graphics capabilities from your CPU's integrated GPU, which would not be ideal if you have a dedicated Graphics Card. The only decent way to get monitors working through a Graphics card and then through a single cable would be with a Thunderbolt add-in card, as you mentioned. These usually have video inputs where you can physically connect the graphics card to the Thunderbolt card, and then the video signal will pass onto whatever Thunderbolt device is connected. If you want to go for one of these, make sure that you get a card that's compatible with your motherboard."}

{"prompt": "Display Issue with older iMac & TS4 I have a late 2013 iMac running Catalina. I am going out the Thunderbolt jack into a TB->USB-C adapter and into a CalDigit TS4. The TS4 is hooked up via USB or USBC to a keyboard, hard drives, and Tourbox console. It is also outputting video via DisplayPort to a Dell P3421W monitor. The iMac recognizes everything but the monitor. I have tried using the TS4's USB-C video output into the Dell's USB-C's video input and that does not solve the issue. I also tried downloading the TS4 driver to the iMac but that did not resolve the issue either. I am also using a 2023 Macbook Pro M2 Max laptop with the TS$ and all is working fine. However, that is my work laptop and I'd like to use my personal computer too. I was able to hookup the iMac directly to the monitor through a TB->HDMI adapter so I don't think the issue is with the monitor or the computer's compatibility. I know I could just run one TB->HDMI cable from the iMac to the monitor and another TB->USB-C cable to the TS4 but I'd like to be able to use one cable run for all my devices. If anyone has any other suggestions on how to resolve this it would be much appreciated.", "completion": "I suspect this may be a limitation of Thunderbolt 1 on your iMac. When you are converting to USB-C, the Thunderbolt port is likely losing its ability to support video, hence this problem. You're kind of at an impasse here, as you can't really use the TS4 as a Thunderbolt device with your iMac to rectify this.

Also, please verify the version of M2 you are using. Base level M2 devices can only support a single monitor over Thunderbolt connections, while the Pro and Max chip can support dual monitors over a single TB connection - so based on your computer this behavior could be expected. Here's some things you can try: First, power cycle your computer. You can do this by disconnecting it from wall power for 30-45 seconds before plugging it back in. Next, let's focus in on the cable connection between your computer and dock. Make sure you are using the included CalDigit Thunderbolt cable, and if that's not possible, ensure that you are using a Thunderbolt cable. A normal USB-C cable here would result in just one monitor working at a time such as you are describing. Beyond that, I recommend you get in touch with our support team.

{"prompt": "TS4: Monitors aren't recognized after shutting down laptop. Hi there, I have an Acer Predator Helios NEO 16 laptop connected via Thunderbolt 4 port to TS4. Windows 11 64bit. If I power the laptop down, on start up the 2 external displays won't be recognized. I have to physically unplug the TS4 thunderbolt cable and re-plug it back in so the monitors will be activated. Is this normal? Should I not be able to fully power off the laptop and turn it back on without the connectivity to the monitors being disrupted? Further, I have disabled 'fast startup' in Windows.", "completion": "It sounds like the wake from sleep command isn't reaching the monitors for some reason. First, power cycle the dock. You can do this by disconnecting it from wall power for 30-45 seconds. This allows the dock to fully discharge, which can clear out any unintended behaviors. If you haven't already, try swapping out the Thunderbolt cable if you can. Sometimes cables act up or don't agree with particular ports, which can lead to degraded performance such as this. If you don't have a spare Thunderbolt cable, try a USB-C cable for the sake of testing. With this, only one monitor will work and Ethernet will likely not work, but if the one monitor wakes after a reset, that tells us it's likely a cable. If the fault appears to be our cable, our support team can help with that. Contact info below. Does this behavior happen when the monitors are directly connected to the computer? I have a monitor that won't wake from sleep unless it's powered off first for some reason, somewhat similar behavior. If none of that does the trick, I recommend you get in touch with our support team at this point. When you reach out, link back to this thread for their reference.

{"prompt": "TS4 Devices Not Detected Hi folks, I have a MBP Intel and M2. I use them at different times throughout the week with the TS4 but have issues where devices connected to the TS4 are not recognized on the M2. When I first got the TS4 I used the MBP Intel to get everything going and all devices work. (usb web cam, usb-c mic). When I need to use the M2 I unplug the power from the TS4, wait about a minute and then connect the M2 and power it on. The only items that seem to work are my external monitor and network. Everything else I have to connect directly to the M2. Does anyone have an idea of what I could do to not have to move cables around when switching between the MBP's?", "completion": "My first thought is that you should try a different Thunderbolt cable. Although the cable is working well with one computer, it's possible because of differences in tolerances or something else, that the cable is not working properly with your second computer. We sometimes see this kind of behavior where a particular cable and computer just don't work right. If you have access to a different Thunderbolt cable, try swapping that in. Alternatively, if you have a USB-C cable, you can swap that in too for the sake of testing. In this scenario, some other stuff would not work as well or not at all - Ethernet will probably stop working over a USB-C connection for example. We just want to see if we can connect those USB devices, so swap out that cable after you've checked if it works or not. If the fault appears to be the cable, and it's ours, let our support team know and they'll be able to take care of this. If that doesn't do the trick (or if it is the cable), you should get in touch with our support team. When you reach out, link back to this thread and let them know what you've tried. Also, list the makes and models of the USB devices that aren't working for their reference. You can best get in touch via email at Support@CalDigit.com"}
