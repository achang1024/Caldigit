{"prompt": "Can you provide detailed information about macOS Ventura/Sonoma and USB/Thunderbolt device security and what steps users should take?", "completion": "We encourage all CalDigit users to upgrade their Macs to macOS 13 Ventura for the best possible experience. This new OS version has resolved small compatibility issues and offers a better user experience, especially for people connecting docks to their Macs.\n\nStarting from macOS 13, Ventura, Apple has implemented a new layer of device connection protection on portable Macs with Apple silicon, such as the M1 and M2. Any new USB or Thunderbolt devices require user approval before the device can communicate with macOS for connections wired directly to the USB4/Thunderbolt 4 port. When a new USB or Thunderbolt device is connected to a Mac, the user will be asked to approve the connection from the pop-up window.\n\nIf you find your CalDigit dock, storage, or any devices connected directly or indirectly to a CalDigit device are working properly prior to macOS 13, but cannot be recognized by macOS Ventura, please ensure you 'allow' the connection when you are asked to approve the connection from the pop-up window.\n\nYou can change this security configuration in System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> and scroll down to the 'Security' section. The default configuration is 'Ask for New Accessories', you can change this to 'Ask Every Time', 'Automatically When Unlocked' or 'Always'. Approved USB/Thunderbolt devices can connect to a locked Mac for up to three days.\n\nIf the pop-up window asking you to allow for the device connection does not appear, or if it appeared for a moment and you didn’t have the opportunity to click it, this will result in nothing behind the CalDigit device or dock working. For example, external monitors and external drives connected to a CalDigit dock will not work. Please change 'Allow accessories to connect' to 'Always' in order for all attached devices to connect as normal.\n\nIf you find the external display connected to your Thunderbolt Dock or Hub no longer work properly after updating to Ventura, please try to update to macOS 13.1 or later.\n\nIf you still have the external monitor problem, please try to boot to safe mode, reconnect the dock, and then restart your Mac and boot back to the normal mode. To start up your Mac in safe mode, please follow the steps on Apple’s support article: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/start-up-your-mac-in-safe-mode-mh21245/mac\n\nPlease turn off 'Variable Refresh Rate' (VRR) or Adaptive Sync such as G-Sync or FreeSync feature from your external display’s OSD menu (on-screen display) if your display is flickering under Ventura."}
{"prompt": "Can you explain why a drive displays different capacities on different operating systems and how measurement standards differ?", "completion": "Determining drive capacity can be confusing because the different OS platforms may use different measurement standards. Both binary and decimal measurements are commonly used in Mac OSX and Windows systems. In either case, a drive’s capacity is measured by using the total number of bytes available on the drive. As long as the drive displays the correct number of bytes, you are getting the drive’s full capacity.\n\nThe most common two ways to display hard disk’s or SSD’s capacity are Decimal and Binary methods.\n\nFor simplicity and consistency, some define a megabyte as 1,000,000 bytes, a gigabyte as 1,000,000,000 bytes and a terabyte as 1,000,000,000,000 bytes. This is referred to as Decimal measurement.\n\nSome, including Windows and older versions of Mac OSX, actually define a megabyte as 1,048,576 bytes, a gigabyte as 1,073,741,824 bytes and a terabyte as 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. This is referred to as Binary measurements.\n\nThis is why different utilities and OS platforms report different capacities for the same drive. The number of bytes may be the same, but a different number of bytes is used to make a megabyte, a gigabyte and a terabyte. For example, CalDigit VR2 10TB displays 9,315GB in Windows, 9 TB on the LCD menu, but shows 10TB in Mac OSX.\n\nApple Disk Utility Example\nWindows Disk Management Example\nNote: Some CalDigit RAID storage would reserve small capacities, normally few megabytes, for RAID table and configuration."}

Notes: This behavior applies to all Thunderbolt Docks and Thunderbolt Display."}
{"prompt": "What should I do if the Ethernet port on TS4 or TS3 Plus is not working properly?", "completion": "Notes: For macOS users, in order to have the most reliable Ethernet connection, please update to the latest macOS13, Ventura or above.\n\nIf the Ethernet port on the TS4 or TS3 Plus can not obtain IP address from DHCP server or does not have any network traffic even it is connected to your router / switch properly, this might be related to your previous network setting in macOS or “Energy Efficient Ethernet” compatibility. Please try the followings to recreate the new Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot in macOS and disable “Energy Efficient Ethernet” (EEE) feature.\n\nNotes: If you previously used other Thunderbolt docks, you may need to remove all the previous and un-used “Thunderbolt Ethernet Slots” in macOS then create a new one for the new dock. For example, if you switch from TS3 Plus to TS4, and TS4’s “Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot X” shows green dot and can obtain IP address from DHCP server but not network traffic, you will need to remove it and re-create a new one in case macOS still uses the old TS3 Plus network setting. See step 2 and 3 below.\n\nA. For macOS:\n\n1. Go to System Preferences -> Network.\n2. You can remove any unused and current “Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot X” that is associated to your new Thunderbolt dock. To do that, highlight the Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot X from the list and click on the “-” (Delete the selected service) button on the bottom left, then click on “Apply” button. Remove all the “Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot” including the unused ones and the one with green dot.\n\n3.

{"prompt": "Can TS3 and TS3 Plus support DisplayPort Multi-stream Transport (MST) feature?", "completion": "MacOS does not currently support MST, and will be able to mirror monitors at best. If you are experiencing problems on Windows, please make sure that you are using DP 1.2 cables and monitors.\n\nBefore we tackle this question, let’s first define MST (Multi-Stream Transport Technology ) so that everyone has a common understanding about MST.\n\nIn a nutshell, there are 3 types of MSTs:\n\n1. MST Tiled\n2. MST Hub (MST Splitter or DisplayPort Splitter)\n3. MST Daisy-Chained\n\nWhen it comes to MST in general, the TS3 and TS3 Plus simply act as a pass-through device from the host computer’s OS (Operating System).\n\n1. MST Tiled: Most early 4K @60Hz monitors on the market, such as Sharp PN-K321, ASUS PQ321Q, Dell UP2414Q and UP3214Q, Panasonic TC-L65WT600 … etc, used Multi-Stream Transport technology to put two halves of a display together onto one large 4K surface to reach 60Hz (Stream 1 + Stream 2). This technique is also referred to as a “tile.” (Monitor with more than one panel).\n\nThis is the MST fully supported by macOS.\n\nDiagram showing how Tiled MST shows 2 video streams on a monitor at once.\nTitled MST Display\n\n2. MST Hub: MST hub is a device that splits the total bandwidth from a DisplayPort 1.2 source to multiple video connections allowing users to connect to more than one monitor simultaneously. MST Hubs can be configures for Mirrored (Duplicated), Extended, or video wall mode.\n\nMST hubs require that the video card’s DisplayPort output support DP1.2 or greater, which supports MST. It is important to note that although some video cards can technically support DP1.2, it may not be supporting MST. Please always check with your video card manufacturer to verify MST compatibility.\n\nCurrently, macOS can only support MST hub in “Mirrored” mode. Users, however, can use BootCamp to run Windows on a late model Mac for MST hub “Extended” mode.\n\n(NOTE: MST hub can also be called MST splitters, or DisplayPort splitters. )\n\nDiagram showing an MST Hub mirroring a DisplayPort Stream across 2 monitors.\nMST Hub\n\n3. MST Daisy-Chained Monitors: DisplayPort v1.2 supports daisy chainable displays having both a DisplayPort input and a DisplayPort output from one monitor. The DisplayPort output connects to the next downstream monitor.\n\nDiagram showing 2 monitors daisy chained to extend two monitors.\nBoth downstream Thunderbolt 3 port and DisplayPort on the TS3 and TS3 Plus support all 3 types of MSTs; MST Tile, MST Hub and MST Daisy-Chained monitors. However, actual MST type support depends on the capability of host computer’s Operating System (OS), graphic card, drivers, intended design and monitors.\n\nSummary\n\nCurrently, Macs running on macOS with Thunderbolt 3 ports can ONLY support MST tiled display that uses MST to accomplish the tiling technique as described above for one 4K Display. When connecting to MST Hub and MST daisy-chained displays, mcOS will show them in cloned mode (mirrored), not extended mode. On the other hand, Windows 10 supports MST Hub and MST Daisy-Chainable monitors to show in Extended mode (2 separate contents).\n\nSimilar results can also be achieved with a Mac running BootCamp on Windows to show Extended Mode.\n\nDiagram comparing the 3 kinds of MST and comparing them between windows.  Tiled MST: 4K 60Hz display on Windows and macOS. MST Hub and Daisy-chained Monitors: mirrored monitors on macOS and extended monitors on Windows.\n* Some Windows Thunderbolt 3 computers such as Dell XPS-13-9365 can support daisy-chained MST displays in extended mode. Some can only support one monitor. ** For more information about MST support, please contact the maker of your display and computers for details."}
{"prompt": "My Monitor Can Not Enter Power Save Mode.", "completion": "If your monitor cannot enter power save mode, please power cycle your monitor by disconnecting it from power for at least 30 seconds, then make sure that “monitor sleep” features are disabled.\n\nWhen connecting a monitor to a CalDigit Dock or a Display-supported storage solution, you may find the monitor can not enter power saving mode even when your computer entered sleep mode. If this is the case, you may try to update firmware on your monitor or reset it to factory default and turn off any built-in “Monitor Sleep” features on the display.\n\nTake the Dell U2718Q monitor as an example. While your computer is in sleep mode, the dell monitor may keep cycling “Scanning for signal…” and “No DP signal from your devices” messages and the monitor itself will not power off. In this case, you may reset the monitor and turn off its internal sleep feature from monitor’s menu settings. This will allow the the display to take sleep commands from the connected host computer when it enters sleep mode. You can do this by\n\nDisconnect all the cables from the Dell U2718Q (including the power cable).\nPress and hold in the U2718Q power button for 30 seconds.\nReconnect the power cable and Dock to the U2718Q. Power on the monitor.\nGo U2718Q OSD menu, and disable “Monitor Sleep” which is under “Personalize” sub-menu.\nPower cycle the monitor.\nDell U2718Q's OSD menu with the setting that controls monitor sleep highlighted. Underneath this is the word \"Disable\" used to indicate that this setting should be disabled."}
{"prompt": "My Windows computer will only connect to one monitor at a time on my Thunderbolt 3 dock!", "completion": "If your Windows computer is unable to connect to one monitor at a time using any of our Thunderbolt 3 docks, your computer may be unable to produce two video signals from the Thunderbolt 3 port that the dock is connected to.\n\nYou can easily determine if this is the case by disconnecting one ‘working’ monitor from your dock and see if the other monitor comes back on. If this is the case, you may have a computer that was made lacking this capability.\n\nIf this is the case, you may still be able to produce dual extended displays through the use of MST (multi-stream transport) through the DisplayPort port. This can be done through an MST Hub connected to the dock or through certain monitors which have both a DisplayPort in and DisplayPort out port.\n\nPlease note: this technique may limit your display capabilities. Using this configuration, one monitor will be limited to a 4k resolution at 30Hz refresh rate and the other will be limited to 2k resolution at 60Hz refresh rate."}
{"prompt": "If I’ve plugged in one or more displays into my TS3 Plus dock and they aren’t showing up, what should I check?", "completion": "If you’ve plugged in one or more displays into your TS3 Plus dock and they aren’t showing up, please check to see if you are connected through the correct ports, using the correct cables and adapters, and using a computer that can support dual video streams out of a single Thunderbolt 3 port.\n\nCheck your video cables.\n\nDue to various reasons some video cables are unable to connect to a display. Typical causes are physical wear and tear, an adapter that isn’t working, or too many adapters chained together to produce a strong signal.\n\nIf you are using any cable with connector pins, please ensure that these pins are in good condition and are not bent or broken.\n\nTo check to see if your cable is working, try to connect the display directly to a computer first.\n\nUse ports that produce video.\n\nOn the TS3 Plus, the only ports that produce video are the Thunderbolt 3 ports and the DisplayPort. If you are trying to connect a monitor to a USB port, this will not be able to produce stable video signals.\n\nUse ‘active’ adapters.\n\nIf you are using an adapter or cable to go from DisplayPort to HDMI, VGA, or DVI, please ensure that this is active. If you are unsure if you have an active cable or adapter rather than a passive one, please check the packaging or website and see if it is labeled specifically.\n\nIf you don’t already have one, we make one that works well with our docks – you can find a link here.\n\nDual video streams.\n\nSome computers are equipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports which are not capable of producing two video streams out at the same time. If you are not able to get your second monitor to connect, an easy way to test if this is the case is to manually disconnect a working monitor to see if the second one pops up.\n\nIf your computer isn’t able to connect to two monitors through the same port, you can always connect a second monitor to your existing setup by connecting the second monitor directly to the computer.\n\nIf you have any questions about this or would like one of our support team members to walk you through these step by step, please contact our support department and we’d be happy to help you."}
{"prompt": "How do I adjust the display resolution on a Mac OSX?", "completion": "By default, Mac OSX chooses the most suitable resolution based on factors such as your monitors, GPU, Thunderbolt capability, and other settings. However, it is possible to adjust the resolution yourself.\n\nFollow the steps below to adjust the resolution:\n\n1. Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Displays.\n\n2. If you connect more than one monitor, you can select “Gather Windows” so that all of the preference windows gather on the primary monitor.\n\n3. Click “Display” on the window associated to the monitor you would like to change, then click Scaled and select a resolution. The resolution list on “Scaled” shows all the possible resolutions possible with your current setup depending on factors such as:\n\nHardware Specifications: GPU/Video Card, Processor, Thunderbolt, HDMI, Display, cable. Software Specifications: Mac OS X version and software drivers.\n\nYou may verify the changes by going to the “Graphics/Displays” section in your system profile. For example, the following shows the display setup of a MacBook Pro 11,1 (Thunderbolt 2) and a Thunderbolt Station 2 HDMI output going to a Samsung U28D590 4K monitor @ 30Hz in 3840×2160."}
